**Welcome to the METplus Training modules!**

Please see the `METplus Website <http://dtcenter.org/community-code/metplus>`_ to learn more about this project.

These training materials describe the use of the 
`METplus Software <https://github.com/dtcenter/METplus>`_ and its components 
(`MET <https://github.com/dtcenter/MET>`_, 
`METviewer <https://github.com/dtcenter/METviewer>`_, 
`METexpress <https://github.com/dtcenter/METexpress>`_, 
`METplotpy <https://github.com/dtcenter/METplotpy>`_, 
`METcalcpy <https://github.com/dtcenter/METcalcpy>`_, and 
`METdatadb <https://github.com/dtcenter/METdatadb>`_).

You can either step through all the videos using the **Previous** and **Next** buttons at the bottom of each page
or go directly to the topic of interest using the top-level navigation options.

While videos are provided for several topics, they are certainly not comprehensive. Please feel free to recommend
new training video topics on the `METplus Discussions <https://github.com/dtcenter/METplus/discussions>`_ page.

Users are encouraged to start by following the :ref:`training_environment` video so they can follow along with the exercises.
Or, if you prefer, you may navigate directly to the training modules and simply watch the videos.
