(show slide 1 - title)

Welcome to the “Find and Navigate the Tutorial” video, part of the “Session 1: Setup” portion of the METplus 4.0 Online Tutorial.

(show slide 2 - Topics Covered in This Video)

This video covers how to get started with the METplus 4.0 online tutorial, including where to find the tutorial pages and how to get started.

(open a web browser and navigate to https://dtcenter.org/metplus-practical-session-guide-version-4-0/session-1-metplus-setupgrid-grid/metplus-setup)

The content in this video corresponds to the online tutorial section titled “METplus Setup” which is found in “Session 1: METplus Setup / Grid-to-Grid.”

To find the METplus online tutorial, navigate to dtcenter.org

(navigate to https://dtcenter.org)

then select “METplus” under the “Community Code” drop down menu.

(mouse over “Community Code” and click on “METplus”)

Next click on “User Support.”

(mouse over the “User Support” button on the menu on the right side of the window,
Reduce the width of the window so that the menu bar disappears from the right side)

You may not see the menu bar on the right-hand side of the window. This occurs when the width of the window is not large enough to display it. If this is the case, navigate to the bottom of the page to find this menu.

(navigate to bottom of page and mouse over the “User Support” menu button)

You can also adjust the width or zoom of your browser window until it appears on the right-hand side.

(demonstrate that increasing the window width and reducing the zoom percentage causes the menu to appear on the right side)

Next click on the “Tutorial - Online” button.

(Click on “Tutorial - Online”)

Finally, click on the link for the “METplus v4.0” tutorial. Previous versions of the online tutorial can also be found here in PDF format.

(navigate to https://dtcenter.org/metplus-practical-session-guide-version-4-0/session-1-metplus-setupgrid-grid)

The first page of the online tutorial describes the format of the instructions.

(scroll to the “Tutorial Format” section of the page)

Text blocks inside dark gray boxes with bold, white text can be copied from the browser and pasted into the command line terminal.
Text blocks inside yellow boxes contain important information or hints.
Text blocks inside light blue boxes contain instructions for the user to perform.
Text blocks inside light gray boxes contain sample output from a command or contents of a file.

(scroll to the “Tutorial Tips” section of the page)
Please note that some of the commands listed in the tutorial instructions use specific applications like vi to open and edit files and okular to view PDF, postscript, and image files. Users are encouraged to use their preferred tools instead of these suggested tools if they are more comfortable with them.

Also please note that if you are running the tutorial instructions inside a Docker container, then the visualization tools used in the tutorial may not be available inside the container. To run these commands, you will have to mount the output directory inside Docker to your local file system and run those tools from there.

(navigate to the bottom of the page and mouse over the line that states “Click the ‘METplus Setup >’ link below to get started!”)

And here is the first instruction of the tutorial telling us to click this link that will take us to the next page of the tutorial.

(click link)

This next page contains a brief overview of the METplus wrappers and a list of links to useful resources such as the user’s guide and the GitHub pages for the various METplus components.

(navigate to next page -- METplus: Initial setup)

This page describes the prerequisites for running the tutorial instructions. It is assumed that you have already installed METplus, including the MET executables and the METplus wrapper scripts, and that you have obtained the sample input data needed to run the exercises.

If you are going through the tutorial on a machine that has been pre-configured to run the tutorial, such as Hera or Cheyenne, then these steps have already been completed for you. If you are going through the tutorial on your own workstation, then you will need to perform the installation steps yourself. If you have not already done so, you can refer to installation videos or the user’s guide.

(scroll down to the Pre-Configured Environments and User Configued Environments sections)

Click on the appropriate link to navigate to the instructions that are specific to the environment you are using.

For all environments, the instructions include steps to determine a working area for the tutorial, create a directory that will contain your configuration and output files, and copy a few files into the directory.

If running on your own workstation, we provide instructions for using bash and c-shell. We recommend using bash if you do not have a preference.
