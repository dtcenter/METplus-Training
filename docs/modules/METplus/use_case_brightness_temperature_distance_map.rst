My name is Christina Kalb, and I'm a scientist working on the METplus team at NCAR.  This video will cover how to run the Brightness Temperature Distance Map use case.  
Specific information about this use case can be found in the `METplus User's Guide <https://metplus.readthedocs.io/en/main_v4.0/Users_Guide>`_.
